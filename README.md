# Codility Solutions in C++

This repository contains solutions to various Codility challenges implemented in C++. Each solution is written with a focus on readability, efficiency, and correctness.

## Structure
- Each challenge is stored in its own folder.
- Each folder contains:
  - The C++ solution file.
  - A README describing the problem and solution approach.
  - Test cases to validate the solution.

## Build and Run
You can compile and run each solution using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`.

Example:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 solution.cpp -o solution
./solution
